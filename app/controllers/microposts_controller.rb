#With the code in Listing 10.24, the signed_in_user method is now avail- able in the Microposts controller, which means that we can restrict access to the create and destroy actions with the before filter shown in Listing 10.25. (Since we didnâ€™t generate it at the command line, you will have to create the Microposts controller file by hand.)
