    user = User.find_by(email: params[:session][:email].downcase) #Pulls the user out of the dtabase using the submitted email addredd (pg. 400)
    if user && user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])  #This uses && (logical and) to determine if the resulting user is valid. Taking into account that any object other than nil and false itself is true in a boolean context (Section 4.2.3), the possibilities appear as in Table 8.2. We see from Table 8.2 that the if statement is true only if a user with the given email both exists in the database and has the given password, exactly as required.
      sign_in user        
      redirect_back_or user   #This evaluates to session[:return_to] unless itâ€™s nil, in which case it evaluates to the given user default URL. 
    else
      flash.now[:error] = 'Invalid email/password combination' # nstead of flash we use flash.now, which is specifically designed for displaying flash messages on rendered pages; unlike the contents of flash, its contents disappear as soon as there is an additional request. The corrected application code appears in Listing 8.12.
